## Output Format

### What's New
[New features customers can use]

## Guidelines

- Write from the customer's perspective — focus on what changed for them, not internal implementation details
- Use plain language; avoid engineering jargon
- Past tense, active voice
- No em-dashes
- Omit changes that are purely internal (refactors, test updates, CI changes) unless they affect the user experience
- Each item should be one sentence
